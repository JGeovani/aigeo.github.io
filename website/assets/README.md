Place a portrait image named `avatar.png` in this folder.

Recommended size: 800x800 or larger, square JPG or PNG. The page references `./assets/avatar.png` for the neon avatar.

If you don't add an image, the page will still show a broken image. To test quickly, you can copy the attached photo into this folder and rename it `avatar.png`.
